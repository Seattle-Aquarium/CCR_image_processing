# CCR_image_processing
This repo is intended to aggregate information regarding the automation of our ROV survey imagery processing.

See [here](https://github.com/Seattle-Aquarium/CCR_development/blob/main/1-pagers/AI-ML_image_processing.md) for a 1-pager description of the problem on our CCR_development repo. 

A folder containing 10 raw (pre-processing, .GPR), preview (pre-processing, .JPEG), and polished (processed, JPEG) can be found [here](https://github.com/zhrandell/CCR_image_processing/tree/main/example_raw_and_processed_photos).
